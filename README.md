# FLOW-PROOF-Beginner-Course-Module-3
First Smart contract project using Structs
This is a smart contract that implements a struct and provides function to add and retrieve struct instances.

# Requirements

1. Deploy a new contract that has a Struct of your choosing inside of it .

2. Create a dictionary or array that contains the Struct you defined.

3. Create a function to add to that array/dictionary.

4. Add a transaction to call that function in step 3.

5. Add a script to read the Struct you defined.

# Usage

peoples : This is a public variable that represents a mapping from 'Address' to 'Person' struct instances

Employees: It is a user defined struct that represents an individual's information. It has the following fields:

'name': A field type of String to store the employees name.

'employeeid': A field type of String to store the employee's id .

'age': A field type of UInt to store the employees age.

'account': A field type of Address to store the person's blockchain address. This is used to uniquely identify individuals in the 'people' mapping.

addEmployees(): This is a public function defined within the contract that allows users to add a new employees information to the 'peoples' mapping. It takes four arguments: 'employeeid','name','age' and 'account'.

init(): This is the contract's contstructor which is called when the contract is deployed. It intializes the contract's people mapping as an empty map.
